## Introduction:

The year 2021 was one of the most challenging years for many industries and businesses due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. This project analyzes data from [CitiBike](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data), a popular bike-sharing service in new york city, to understand how the pandemic affected usage and patterns in 2021. There were a total of 27 million rides in 2021, but 500k random rows were chosen from the total dataset in this project. With the use of tableau visualizations, we will dive into the data to see the trends and usage throughout the year to provide a deeper understanding of how the pandemic impacted CitiBike usage.

For this assignment, the goal was to build an interactive dashboard to explore the [CitiBike](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset revealed that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Steps taken:

1. Used Jupyter Notebook was used to clean up the months downloaded for the year of 2021 and combined it into 1 big pandas dataframe. January 2021's Data had headers in a different order so the rows were reorders and matched with the rest of the year. The total amount of rows for 2021 was over 27 Million, but my computer ended up only working with around 500K rows, which is how much I went with. Lastly, the Pandas Dataframe was converted into a csv file and the cleaned file was downloaded to \resources\cleaned_data. (Didn't push to GitHub due to files being over 5GB)

2. Opened the final cleaned_data CSV file in Tableau and came up with an interesting story with the given
